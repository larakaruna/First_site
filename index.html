<h1> Hello! </h1>
My name is Lara </br>
coding is cool
<br> this is sixth week </br>
<br> I could write poems on here  </br>
<br> my creative skills are looking bleak </br>
perhaps I have hit a peak 
<br> now I am bored of these rhyming pairs </br>
I will now talk about some squares 
<br> squares, squares, not so rare </br>
